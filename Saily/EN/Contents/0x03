Answer:
//BLANK-LINE//
      After jailbroken, your device is still safe. The apps you download from the App Store still work in their own black boxes, don't see each other, and don't know each other. 
//BLANK-LINE//
      However, your device's OpenSSH administrator password needs your attention. In the case of OpenSSH installed, his default password is the engineering code of the first generation iPhone: "alpine". You need to modify him.
//BLANK-LINE//
      Among them, jailbreaks handled by Coolstar, such as Electra and Chimera, have OpenSSH enabled by default, while other jailbreaks such as Uncover are not installed by default.

So how do we change the password? First, you need to add a package repo
